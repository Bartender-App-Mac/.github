## 🧩 Overview  

**Bartender for macOS** is a sleek and intelligent utility that gives you complete control over your Mac’s menu bar. Designed to declutter and optimize your workspace, Bartender allows you to hide, rearrange, and manage menu bar icons with precision — keeping your desktop clean, organized, and distraction-free.  

With Bartender, you can group system icons, third-party tools, and status indicators into custom layouts that appear only when needed. Whether you’re working on a compact MacBook screen or a wide desktop display, it ensures that your menu bar always stays minimal and functional.  

The app supports **keyboard shortcuts**, **search functionality**, and **auto-hide options**, making it effortless to locate hidden items or quickly access the icons you use most. It also includes **menu bar triggers**, letting icons reappear dynamically when they update or change state — so you never miss important notifications or background processes.  

Built natively for **Apple Silicon**, Bartender delivers excellent performance and low resource usage. It’s an essential utility for power users, developers, and anyone who values focus, organization, and control on macOS.
